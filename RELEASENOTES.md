### Version 2.0.0-beta.11 (_14/Jul/2020_)

#### Improvements

#### PowerShell 7 (Core) support

- Most cmdlets are now run in both Windows PowerShell and PowerShell 7;
- Exception made to those cmdlets still relying on the old Client Object Model library (e.g. most cmdlets that operate on a configuration server level);
- TfsCmdlets is expected to work on Linux and Mac, although it's been only lightly tested on Linux and have not been tested on a Mac **at all**.

#### New cmdlets

- Connect-TfsTeam
- Disconnect-TfsTeam
- Enter-TfsShell
- Exit-TfsShell
- Get-TfsReleaseDefinition
- Get-TfsVersion
- New-TfsProcessTemplate
- New-TfsTestPlan
- Remove-TfsWorkItemTag
- Rename-TfsGlobalList
- Rename-TfsTeamProject
- Rename-TfsTestPlan
- Search-TfsWorkItem
- Undo-TfsTeamProjectRemoval

#### Other improvements 

- **Documentation site**: Published new [documentation site](https://tfscmdlets.dev) (**WORK IN PROGRESS**)
- **Get-Help**: All cmdlets are now (most) properly documented. Examples are still missing in many of them, but all are guaranteed to have, at least, synopsis and parameter documentation.

#### Breaking Changes

- TfsCmdlets won't run on earlier versions of PowerShell. Please use either **Windows PowerShell 5.1** or **PowerShell 7 (Core)**.
- `Get-TfsCredential` renamed to `New-TfsCredential`
- `Get-TfsPolicyType` renamed to `Get-GitTfsPolicyType`
- `Get-TfsTeamBacklog` renamed to `Get-TfsTeamBacklogLevel`
- `Get-TfsTeamBoardCardRuleSettings` renamed to `Get-TfsTeamBoardCardRule`
- `Set-TfsTeamBoardCardRuleSettings` renamed to `Set-TfsTeamBoardCardRule`
- Removed `Set-TfsArea`, since same result can be obtained by using either `Rename-TfsArea` or `Move-TfsArea`
- Removed `Set-TfsWorkItemBoardStatus`, since same result can be obtained by using either `Set-TfsWorkItem`

#### Known issues

- PowerShell Core **only supports PAT (Personal Access Token)** logins. All other authentication methods (username/password, credential object, interactive) will only work in Windows PowerShell;
- Some cmdlets haven't been ported to .NET yet and thus will throw a `NotImplementedException` exception when first run.

### Version 2.0.0-beta.11 (_21/Jan/2020_)

#### Improvements

##### New cmdlets: `Enter-TfsShell`, `Exit-TfsShell`, `Get-TfsVersion`, `Invoke-TfsRestApi`

The new `Enter-TfsShell` and `Exit-TfsShell` cmdlets streamline the invocation of the "Azure DevOps Shell" mode. When invoked, shows a banner with the module version and activates the custom console prompt. The custom prompt displays the currently connected Azure DevOps org/server.

`Invoke-TfsRestApi` can be used to streamline calls to the Azure DevOps REST API for scenarios/APIs not yet covered by TfsCmdlets.

Lastly, `Get-TfsVersion` returns version information on a given team project collection / organization. Currently, only Azure DevOps Services organizations are supported. Support for TFS and Azure DevOps Server will be added in a future release.

##### Convert work item query-related cmdlets (`*-TfsWorkItemQuery`, `*-TfsWorkItemQueryFolder`) to REST API

In the process, they've been generalized and converted to aliases to their new "generic" counterparts (`*-TfsWorkItemQueryItem`), much like the Area/Iteration cmdlets.

##### Convert PowerShell Format/Types XML files (*.Format.ps1xml, *.Types.ps1xml) to YAML

Now both **TfsCmdlets.Types.ps1xml** and **TfsCmdlets.Format.ps1xml** files are generated during build time from YAML files with [ps1xmlgen](https://github.com/igoravl/ps1xmlgen). That offers a much better experience to edit/mantain PowerShell's type/format XML files.

##### Argument completers

This improvement is way overdue, but now we have the first set of argument completers. Any cmdlets with the arguments `-Server`, `-Collection` and `-Project` can be "Tab-completed".

##### New aliases for Connect-* cmdlets

Now, to connect to a Azure DevOps (or TFS) collection/organization/project/team you can use optionally use one of the aliases below:

* Connect-TfsConfigurationServer
  * ctfssvr
* Connect-TfsTeamProjectCollection
  * Connect-AzdoOrganization
  * Connect-TfsOrganization
  * ctfs
* Connect-TfsTeamProject
  * ctfstp
* Connect-TfsTeam
  * ctfsteam

- Fix classification node (area/iteration) retrieval for old APIs ([0df3616](https://github.com/igoravl/TfsCmdlets/pull/98/commits/0df3616868a15054125261555ecefed1d830d599))

- Fix Azure DevOps Shell command prompt
- Fix Disconnect-* issues

#### Known issues

- Incremental build is currently disabled in the default Visual Studio Code Build task, as it's a bit inconsistent.

### Version 2.0.0-beta.10 (_12/Sep/2019_)

#### Improvements

- Not an improvement per se, but the *MoveBy* argument in the Set-TfsClassificationNode cmdlet (and related area/iteration ones) now displays a 'deprecated' warning when MoveBy is specified. The argument is then ignored.

#### Bug fixes

- Fix an issue with Area/Iteration cmdlets not processing pipelines correctly

#### Known issues

- N/A

### Version 2.0.0-beta.9 (_10/Sep/2019_)

#### Improvements

- Add folder management cmdlets for Build and Release Definitions:
  - Build
    - Get-TfsBuildDefinitionFolder
    - New-TfsBuildDefinitionFolder
    - Remove-TfsBuildDefinitionFolder
  - Release
    - Get-TfsReleaseDefinitionFolder
    - New-TfsReleaseDefinitionFolder
    - Remove-TfsReleaseDefinitionFolder

#### Bug fixes

N/A

#### Known issues

- Set-TfsArea and Set-TfsIteration no longer support reordering of node (`-MoveBy` argument). Still trying to figure out how to do it with the REST API

### Version 2.0.0-beta.8 (_06/Sep/2019_)

#### Improvements

- Area/iteration cmdlets have been ported to the new REST API
- New "generic" versions of the area/iteration cmdlets are now available. `*-TfsClassificationNode` cmdlets have a `-StructureGroup` argument that accepts either 'Areas' or 'Iterations'. Actually, area and iteration cmdlets (`*-TfsArea` and `*-TfsIteration`) are now merely aliases to their respective `*-TfsClassificationNode` counterparts.

#### Bug fixes

- Fix a bug in Connect-TfsTeamProjectCollection when passing a credential ([27dd30](https://github.com/igoravl/TfsCmdlets/commit/27dd302e1b243436229c3f44fa138c22952718b3))

#### Known issues

- Set-TfsArea and Set-TfsIteration no longer support reordering of node (`-MoveBy` argument). Still trying to figure out how to do it with the REST API

#### Known Issues

- N/A

### 1.0.0-alpha5 (_10/Sep/2015_)

#### Improvements

- Add cascade disconnection: When calling a "higher" Disconnect cmdlet (e.g. Disconnect-TfsConfigurationServer), the "lower" ones (e.g. TeamProjectCollection, TeamProject) are cascade-invoked, in other to prevent inconsistent connection information.

#### Bug fixes

- Fix an issue in the AssemblyResolver implementation. Previously it was implemented as a scriptblock and was running into some race conditions that would crash PowerShell. Switched to a pure .NET implementation in order to avoid the race condition.

#### Known Issues

- TfsCmdlets has currently a dependency on .NET 3.5 and won't load in computers with only .NET 4.x installed. Workaround is to install .NET 3.5. Next version will no longer depend on .NET 3.5.
