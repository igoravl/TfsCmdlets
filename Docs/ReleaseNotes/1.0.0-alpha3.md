# TfsCmdlets Release Notes

## Version 1.0.0-alpha4 (_03/Sep/2015_)

### Improvements

* Add help comments to the Areas & Iterations functions

### Bug fixes

* Fix an issue in the AssemblyResolver implementation. Previously it was implemented as a scriptblock and was running into some race conditions that would crash PowerShell. Switched to a pure .NET implementation in order to avoid the race condition.

### Known Issues

* TfsCmdlets has currently a dependency on .NET 3.5 and won't load in computers with only .NET 4.x installed. Workaround is to install .NET 3.5. Next version will no longer depend on .NET 3.5.
