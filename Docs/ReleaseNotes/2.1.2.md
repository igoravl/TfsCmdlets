# TfsCmdlets Release Notes

## Version 2.1.2 (_10/Sep/2021_)

This release fixes [issue #124](https://github.com/igoravl/TfsCmdlets/issues/124), plus some small refactorings/housekeeping.

## Fixes

- **Double confirmation in Remove-TfsGitRepository (and others)**: Many cmdlets (all `Remove-*` ones, and a few others) used to have a ConfirmImpact level set to High. At the same time, some of those also have a Force/ShouldContinue() logic. This meant that the user would be asked for confirmation twice: once when calling ShouldProcess(), and again when calling ShouldContinue(). Now, all cmdlets have their ConfirmImpact set to Medium, and those with potentially destructive actions have a ShouldContinue() call, that can be supressed by the user with the Force parameter.

## Misc

- Adds support to automatic WinGet manifest update and PR creation;
- Updates icon URL in the Nuget/Chocolatey manifest to a higher-res version;
- Adds list of exported cmdlets to the module manifest (psd1);
- Nested modules are now being merged during build-time to improve module loading performance.
