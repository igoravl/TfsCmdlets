# TfsCmdlets Release Notes

## Version 2.2.0 (_??/???/????_)

## New cmdlets

* **`Enable-TfsWorkItemTag` and `Disable-TfsWorkItemTag`**: 
* **`Copy-TfsArea` and `Copy-TfsIteration`**: 
* **User-related cmdlets: `Get-TfsUser`, `New-TfsUser`, `Remove-TfsUser`**: 
* **Avatar-related cmdlets: `Import-TfsTeamProjectAvatar`, `Export-TfsTeamProjectAvatar` and `Remove-TfsTeamProjectAvatar`**: 
* **Group-related cmdlets: `New-TfsGroup` and `Remove-TfsGroup`**: 

## Improvements

* **Add -NoProfile to Enter-TfsShell**: 
* **`Import-TfsWorkItemType` and `Export-TfsWorkItemType` now support file paths**: 
* **New `-Length` argument in `New-TfsIteration` and `Set-TfsIteration`**: 

## Fixes

* Fixes a bug in `Set-TfsTeam` where the -IterationPaths argument was ignored, and the sprint iterations were not set. Now sprint iterations are correctly set.

## BREAKING CHANGES

Some legacy cmdlets (mostly those that rely on the old TFS Client Object Model) have been temporarily removed.

They will eventually return in a future release when we determine the best course of action to support legacy cmdlets moving forward.

In the meantime, please consider using a previous release if you need them.

The removed cmdlets are:

* **Configuration Server** cmdlets
  * `Connect-TfsConfigurationServer`
  * `Disconnect-TfsConfigurationServer`
  * `Get-TfsConfigurationServer`
  * `Get-TfsRegisteredConfigurationServer`
* **Global List** cmdlets
  * `Export-TfsGlobalList`
  * `Get-TfsGlobalList`
  * `Import-TfsGlobalList`
  * `New-TfsGlobalList`
  * `Remove-TfsGlobalList`
  * `Rename-TfsGlobalList`
  * `Set-TfsGlobalList`
* **Team Project Collection Server** cmdlets
  * `Dismount-TfsTeamProjectCollection`
  * `Mount-TfsTeamProjectCollection`
  * `Start-TfsTeamProjectCollection`
  * `Stop-TfsTeamProjectCollection`
