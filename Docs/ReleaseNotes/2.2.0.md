## Improvements
  
* Add -NoProfile to Enter-TfsShell ([#145](https://github.com/igoravl/TfsCmdlets/issues/145))
* **`Import-TfsWorkItemType` and `Export-TfsWorkItemType` now support file paths**: 
* Support array of items in Get-TfsTeamProject ([#155](https://github.com/igoravl/TfsCmdlets/issues/155))

## Fixes

* Fixes a bug in `Set-TfsTeam` where the -IterationPaths argument was ignored, and the sprint iterations were not set. Now sprint iterations are set as expected.
* Get-TfsGroupMember does not work with PS Core and Azure DevOps Services ([#149](https://github.com/igoravl/TfsCmdlets/issues/149))
* Remove trailing slash from org name in prompt ([#148](https://github.com/igoravl/TfsCmdlets/issues/148))
* New-TfsWorkItem fails when specifying area and iteration without prefixing team project ([#147](https://github.com/igoravl/TfsCmdlets/issues/147))

## BREAKING CHANGES

### Removed cmdlets

Some legacy cmdlets (mostly those that rely on the old TFS Client Object Model) have been temporarily removed.

They _may_ return in a future release when we determine the best course of action to support legacy cmdlets moving forward.

In the meantime, please consider using a previous release if you need them.

The removed cmdlets are:

* **Configuration Server** cmdlets
  * `Connect-TfsConfigurationServer`
  * `Disconnect-TfsConfigurationServer`
  * `Get-TfsConfigurationServer`
  * `Get-TfsRegisteredConfigurationServer`
* **Global List** cmdlets
  * `Export-TfsGlobalList`
  * `Get-TfsGlobalList`
  * `Import-TfsGlobalList`
  * `New-TfsGlobalList`
  * `Remove-TfsGlobalList`
  * `Rename-TfsGlobalList`
  * `Set-TfsGlobalList`
* **Pipeline** cmdlets
  * `Start-TfsXamlBuild`
* **Team Project Collection** cmdlets
  * `Dismount-TfsTeamProjectCollection`
  * `Mount-TfsTeamProjectCollection`
  * `Start-TfsTeamProjectCollection`
  * `Stop-TfsTeamProjectCollection`
