# TfsCmdlets Release Notes

## Version 2.2.0 (_??/???/????_)

## New cmdlets

* **Extension Management**
  * `Enable-TfsExtension`, `Disable-TfsExtension`: 
  * `Get-TfsExtension`: 
  * `Install-TfsExtension`: 
  * `Uninstall-TfsExtension`: 
* **Groups**: 
  * `New-TfsGroup`: 
  * `Remove-TfsGroup`: 
* **Team project**:
  * `Import-TfsTeamProjectAvatar`: 
  * `Export-TfsTeamProjectAvatar`: 
  * `Remove-TfsTeamProjectAvatar`: 
* **Work Items**
  * `Enable-TfsWorkItemTag`, `Disable-TfsWorkItemTag`: 
  * `Copy-TfsArea`, `Copy-TfsIteration`**: 
* **Users**
  * `Get-TfsUser`: 
  * `New-TfsUser`: 
  * `Remove-TfsUser`: 

## Improvements

* **Add -NoProfile to Enter-TfsShell**: 
* **`Import-TfsWorkItemType` and `Export-TfsWorkItemType` now support file paths**: 
* **New `-Length` argument in `New-TfsIteration` and `Set-TfsIteration`**: 

## Fixes

* Fixes a bug in `Set-TfsTeam` where the -IterationPaths argument was ignored, and the sprint iterations were not set. Now sprint iterations are set as expected.

## BREAKING CHANGES

Some legacy cmdlets (mostly those that rely on the old TFS Client Object Model) have been temporarily removed.

They _may_ return in a future release when we determine the best course of action to support legacy cmdlets moving forward.

In the meantime, please consider using a previous release if you need them.

The removed cmdlets are:

* **Configuration Server** cmdlets
  * `Connect-TfsConfigurationServer`
  * `Disconnect-TfsConfigurationServer`
  * `Get-TfsConfigurationServer`
  * `Get-TfsRegisteredConfigurationServer`
* **Global List** cmdlets
  * `Export-TfsGlobalList`
  * `Get-TfsGlobalList`
  * `Import-TfsGlobalList`
  * `New-TfsGlobalList`
  * `Remove-TfsGlobalList`
  * `Rename-TfsGlobalList`
  * `Set-TfsGlobalList`
* **Pipeline** cmdlets
  * `Start-TfsXamlBuild`
* **Team Project Collection** cmdlets
  * `Dismount-TfsTeamProjectCollection`
  * `Mount-TfsTeamProjectCollection`
  * `Start-TfsTeamProjectCollection`
  * `Stop-TfsTeamProjectCollection`
