# TfsCmdlets Release Notes

## Version 1.0.0-alpha5 (_10/Sep/2015_)

### Improvements

* Add cascade disconnection: When calling a "higher" Disconnect cmdlet (e.g. Disconnect-TfsConfigurationServer), the "lower" ones (e.g. TeamProjectCollection, TeamProject) are cascade-invoked, in other to prevent inconsistent connection information.

* Fix conditional use of -Title in New-TfsWorkItem ([96a8a60](https://github.com/igoravl/tfscmdlets/commit/818af6e9d6ba3f30e976f3ef20d6070ac50fa3e7))

* Fix return when passing -Current in Get-TfsConfigurationServer ([58647d2f](https://github.com/igoravl/tfscmdlets/commit/58647d2f29d84d6f5db4e0022062c2dd30cfaba1))
