# TfsCmdlets Release Notes

## Version 2.9.1 (_05/Jun/2025_)

This release fixes a critical bug in Set-TfsWorkItem, among other improvements.

## Fixes

- **`Get-TfsVersion`**: Adds support for Azure DevOps Services version "20" (currently mapped to 2022)
- **`Remove-TfsTeamProject`**: Removes a double-confirmation prompt when using the `-Hard` switch, simplifying the deletion process
- **`Set-TfsWorkItem`**: Fixed an issue where the actual work item ID wasn't being used when retrieving work item type information, causing some field updates to fail
