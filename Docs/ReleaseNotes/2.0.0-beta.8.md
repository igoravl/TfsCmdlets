# TfsCmdlets Release Notes

## Version 2.0.0-beta.8 (_06/Sep/2019_)

### Improvements

- Area/iteration cmdlets have been ported to the new REST API
- New "generic" versions of the area/iteration cmdlets are now available. `*-TfsClassificationNode` cmdlets have a `-StructureGroup` argument that accepts either 'Areas' or 'Iterations'. Actually, area and iteration cmdlets (`*-TfsArea` and `*-TfsIteration`) are now merely aliases to their respective `*-TfsClassificationNode` counterparts.

### Bug fixes

- Fix a bug in Connect-TfsTeamProjectCollection when passing a credential ([27dd30](https://github.com/igoravl/TfsCmdlets/commit/27dd302e1b243436229c3f44fa138c22952718b3))

### Known issues

- Set-TfsArea and Set-TfsIteration no longer support reordering of node (`-MoveBy` argument). Still trying to figure out how to do it with the REST API
