# TfsCmdlets Release Notes

## Version 2.0.0 (_31/Jul/2021_)

First official release in the 2.0 series, it has a few improvements over the previous release.

## Improvements

- **New defaults in New-TfsTeamProject**: New-TfsTeamProject now has default values for arguments `SourceControl` (defaults to **Git**) and `ProcessTemplate` (defaults to the default process template in the organization). With that, the only required argument to create a team project is its name. (fixes [#116](https://github.com/igoravl/TfsCmdlets/issues/116))
- **Iteration dates in New-TfsIteration**: This cmdlet has two new arguments, `StartDate` and `FinishDate`, so that iteration dates can be set during creation with a single command. Previously, it has needed to call **Set-TfsIteration** after creating an iteration.
- **Support for ErrorAction**: Some cmdlets - namely **Get-TfsTeamProject** and **Get-TfsWorkItem** - now support `-ErrorAction`. This way, a script can continue running when there is an error fetching some of requested items .
