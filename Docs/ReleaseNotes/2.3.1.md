# TfsCmdlets Release Notes

## Version 2.3.1 (_07/Apr/2022_)

This release brings a few minor fixes to Team cmdlets and to pipeline handling. No new features and/or cmdlets have been introduced in this version.

## Fixes

* `Get-TfsTeam` and `Get-TfsTeamProject` were limited to a maximum of 100 results. This has been fixed. Now they will return all results.
* Under certain circumstances, `Get-TfsTeamProjectCollection` (and, by extension, Get-TfsOrganization) would throw an error with the message "_Invalid or non-existent Collection System.Object[]._" (fixes [#165](https://github.com/igoravl/TfsCmdlets/issues/165))
* Fixes a caching bug in the handling of the -Project parameter that could lead to the wrong project being returned.
* Fixes pipelining bugs in several cmdlets (most noticeably `Get-TfsReposity`, which wouldn't work when connected to a pipeline).
* Improves the readability of ShouldProcess (Confirm / WhatIf) output in several cmdlets.
