# TfsCmdlets Release Notes

## Version 2.1.1 (_08/Sep/2021_)

This release fixes a regression in New-TfsArea and New-TfsIteration, that stopped working due to a mishandling of path strings.

## Fixes

- Fixes error "`Parent node '\' does not exist. Check the path or use -Force the create any missing parent nodes`" when creating a new area or iteration.
