# TfsCmdlets Release Notes

## Version 2.6.1 (_15/May/2024_)

Ouch! It's been a while since the last release! Some times life gets in the way, but I'm back!

This release fixes bugs in `Get-TfsWorkItem`, `Get-TfsArea`, `Get-TfsIteration`, `Invoke-TfsRestApi`, `New-TfsTeam` and `Set-TfsTeam`.

## Fixes

* Fixes [#211](https://github.com/igoravl/TfsCmdlets/issues/211), where `Get-TfsWorkItem` would throw an error when the `-Fields` parameter was "*".
* Fixes a bug in `Invoke-TfsRestApi` where Azure DevOps APIs whose responses were missing the `content-type` header would throw an error.
* Fixes a bug in `Get-TfsArea` and `Get-TfsIteration` where team projects containing Regex-reserved characters (such as parentheses) would throw an error.
* Fixes a bug in `Get-TfsWorkItem` where the `-AreaPath` and `-IterationPath` parameters would not work when the specified path either started with a backslash or did not contain the team project name.
