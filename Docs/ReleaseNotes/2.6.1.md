# TfsCmdlets Release Notes

## Version 2.6.1 (_15/May/2024_)

Ouch! It's been a while since the last release! Sometimes life gets in the way, but I'm back!

This release fixes bugs in `Get-TfsWorkItem`, `Get-TfsArea`, `Get-TfsIteration`, `Invoke-TfsRestApi`, `New-TfsTeam` and `Set-TfsTeam`.

## Fixes

* Fixes [#211](https://github.com/igoravl/TfsCmdlets/issues/211), where `Get-TfsWorkItem` would throw an error when the `-Fields` parameter was "*".
* Fixes a bug in `Invoke-TfsRestApi` where Azure DevOps APIs whose responses were missing the `content-type` header would throw an error.
* Fixes a bug in `Get-TfsArea` and `Get-TfsIteration` where team projects containing Regex-reserved characters (such as parentheses) would throw an error. This bug would indirectly affect `New-TfsTeam` and `Set-TfsTeam` due to their reliance on the same underlying class to handle area and iteration paths when creating/updating teams.
* Fixes a bug in `Get-TfsWorkItem` where the `-AreaPath` and `-IterationPath` parameters would not work when the specified path either started with a backslash or did not contain the team project name.
* Adds the installed module version to the _Azure DevOps Shell_ startup command to prevent loading an older version of the module when the PSModulePath variable contains an older version of the module listed earlier in the search path.
