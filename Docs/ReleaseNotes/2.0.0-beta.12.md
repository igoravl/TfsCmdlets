# TfsCmdlets Release Notes

## Version 2.0.0-beta.12 (_14/Jul/2020_)

## Improvements

### PowerShell 7 (Core) support

- Most cmdlets are now run in both Windows PowerShell and PowerShell 7;
- Exception made to those cmdlets still relying on the old Client Object Model library (e.g. most cmdlets that operate on a configuration server level);
- TfsCmdlets is expected to work on Linux and Mac, although it's been only lightly tested on Linux and have not been tested on a Mac **at all**.

### New cmdlets

- Connect-TfsTeam
- Disconnect-TfsTeam
- Enter-TfsShell
- Exit-TfsShell
- Get-TfsReleaseDefinition
- Get-TfsVersion
- New-TfsProcessTemplate
- New-TfsTestPlan
- Remove-TfsWorkItemTag
- Rename-TfsGlobalList
- Rename-TfsTeamProject
- Rename-TfsTestPlan
- Search-TfsWorkItem
- Undo-TfsTeamProjectRemoval

### Other improvements 

- **Documentation site**: Published new [documentation site](https://tfscmdlets.dev) (**WORK IN PROGRESS**)
- **Get-Help**: All cmdlets are now (most) properly documented. Examples are still missing in many of them, but all are guaranteed to have, at least, synopsis and parameter documentation.

### Breaking Changes

- TfsCmdlets won't run on earlier versions of PowerShell. Please use either **Windows PowerShell 5.1** or **PowerShell 7 (Core)**.
- `Get-TfsCredential` renamed to `New-TfsCredential`
- `Get-TfsPolicyType` renamed to `Get-GitTfsPolicyType`
- `Get-TfsTeamBacklog` renamed to `Get-TfsTeamBacklogLevel`
- `Get-TfsTeamBoardCardRuleSettings` renamed to `Get-TfsTeamBoardCardRule`
- `Set-TfsTeamBoardCardRuleSettings` renamed to `Set-TfsTeamBoardCardRule`
- Removed `Set-TfsArea`, since same result can be obtained by using either `Rename-TfsArea` or `Move-TfsArea`
- Removed `Set-TfsWorkItemBoardStatus`, since same result can be obtained by using either `Set-TfsWorkItem`

### Known issues

- PowerShell Core **only supports PAT (Personal Access Token)** logins. All other authentication methods (username/password, credential object, interactive) will only work in Windows PowerShell;
- Some cmdlets haven't been ported to .NET yet and thus will throw a `NotImplementedException` exception when first run.
