# TfsCmdlets Release Notes

## Version 2.10.0 (_22/Aug/2024_)

This release adds new pipeline-related cmdlets.

## New cmdlets

- **`Get-TfsPipelineRun`**: Gets one or more pipeline (build) runs in a team project.
- **`Start-TfsPipelineRun`**: Queues (starts) a new pipeline run.
- **`Stop-TfsPipelineRun`**: Cancels (stops) a running pipeline.

## Changes and enhancements

- **`Start-TfsBuild`**: Renamed to `Start-TfsPipelineRun` to better align with the new Azure Pipelines terminology. A new alias `Start-TfsBuild` was added to keep compatibility with existing scripts.
