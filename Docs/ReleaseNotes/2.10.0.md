# TfsCmdlets Release Notes

## Version 2.10.0 (_20/Aug/2024_)

This release adds new pipeline-related cmdlets.

## New cmdlets

- **`Get-TfsPipelineRun`**: Gets one or more pipeline (build) runs in a team project.
- **`Start-TfsPipelineRun`**: Queues (starts) a new pipeline run.
- **`Stop-TfsPipelineRun`**: Cancels (stops) a running pipeline.

## Changes and enhancements

- **`Start-TfsBuild`**: Renamed to `Start-TfsPipelineRun` to better align with the new Azure Pipelines terminology. A new alias `Start-TfsBuild` was added to keep compatibility with existing scripts.

## Bug fixes

- **`Connect-TfsOrganization`** (and **`Connect-TfsTeamProjectCollection`**): Resolved an issue where connections, including failed ones, were being cached and reused in subsequent calls. This caused problems when attempting to reconnect after a failure due to invalid credentials, as the cached connection (with the invalid credentials) would be reused.
