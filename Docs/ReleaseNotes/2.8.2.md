# TfsCmdlets Release Notes

## Version 2.8.2 (_24/Jul/2024_)

This release brings some fixes and enhancements.

### Enhancements

- `Add-TfsWorkItemLink`: Added support for specifying the arguments `-SuppressNotification` and `-BypassRules` to suppress notifications and bypass rules when adding a work item link.
- Now when when a cmdlet fails, a full exception dump will be sent to the verbose output stream in addition to the short error message sent to the error stream. So, if your script is failing and you don't know why, you can enable the verbose output to get more information about the error.

### Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the `Get-TfsTeam` cmdlet would not work when specifying the `-Default` parameter.
- Fixed an issue where `Invoke-TfsRestApi` would ignore the parameters passed via the `-Parameters` argument [[#228](https://github.com/igoravl/TfsCmdlets/issues/)]
