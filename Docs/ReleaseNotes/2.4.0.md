# TfsCmdlets Release Notes

## Version 2.4.0 (_23/Apr/2022_)

This release adds support for interactive logons in PowerShell Core (6+) shells.

## Improvements

All the `Connect-*` cmdlets now support interactive (`-Interactive`) logon in PowerShell Core (6+) shells. Previously, only Windows PowerShell (5.*) terminals supported interactive authentication.

**NOTE**: Notice, however, that interactive logon in PowerShell Core requires Azure DevOps Services. TFS / Azure DevOps Server remain unsupported for interactive logons in PowerShell Core. To connect to an on-premises server in a PowerShell Core shell, you're still required to use either username/password credentials or a personal access token.
