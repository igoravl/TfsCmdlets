# TfsCmdlets Release Notes

## Version 2.1.4 (_30/Nov/2021_)

This release fixes a couple issues in `Get-TfsIdentity` and `Invoke-TfsRestApi`.

## Fixes

- **Error when using Get-TfsIdentity with Azure DevOps Services**: Get-TfsIdentity is a cmdlet that helps to deal with legacy APIs, such as the Azure DevOps Security API. To fetch an identiy, it connected to a configuration server (the "root" of an Azure DevOps installation) and called the required API. However, connecting to a configuration server is not supported when using Azure DevOps Services. Now, when used with Azure DevOps Services, Get-TfsIdentity will use the collection (organization) scope for the API, whereas calls to the on-prem server still target the configuration server.

- **Error calling Invoke-TfsRestApi for alternate hosts under Windows PowerShell (Desktop)**: There was a bug in the implementation of Invoke-TfsRestApi that caused it to fail when using alternate hosts in Windows PowerShell. This has been fixed.
