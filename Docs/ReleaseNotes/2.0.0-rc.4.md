# TfsCmdlets Release Notes

## Version 2.0.0-rc.3 (_19/Feb/2021_)

Improve work item link support.

## Improvements

- **Get Work Item by URL**: Now `Get-TfsWorkItem` can receive a URL to a work item (in the form of `https://dev.azure.com/<org>/<proj>/_apis/wit/workItems/<id>`) as a parameter. This way, APIs that return URLs to work items (such as work item links) can be easily "rehydrated" by simply supplying the returned URL to `Get-TfsWorkItem`.
- **Add filter by well-known link types** ([8a487b9](https://github.com/igoravl/TfsCmdlets/pull/127/commits/8a487b99e2d54f671887c76f7effad1235f2b0f9)): Now `Get-TfsWorkItemLink` has a **LinkType** argument, to retrieve only the links of the specified type.
- **Add format to WorkItemRelation** ([4b10ae4](https://github.com/igoravl/TfsCmdlets/pull/127/commits/4b10ae48872430d36966a31603495b73e739bf79)): Objects of type WorkItemRelation are now properly formatted when outputted - added to support `Get-TfsWorkItemLink`.

## Fixes

- Fix bug in parameter override logic ([fdba69a](https://github.com/igoravl/TfsCmdlets/pull/127/commits/fdba69a6325277fbc6215f4507b73b707c877375))
- Fix StructureGroup value in New-TfsIteration ([f18609e](https://github.com/igoravl/TfsCmdlets/pull/127/commits/f18609ec3727d2c6cc9a58c068142862cc59813c))

## BREAKING CHANGES

The pipeline input parameter for `Get-TfsWorkItem` has changed from **Project** to **WorkItem**. Scripts that rely on piping projects to `Get-TfsWorkItem` will stop working.

This change was made to better support scenarios such as retrieving the work items referenced by the links returned by `Get-TfsWorkItemLink`. A typical usage would be:

```powershell
# Gets the parent of work item #123
Get-TfsWorkItemLink -WorkItem 123 -LinkType Parent | Get-TfsWorkItem
```
