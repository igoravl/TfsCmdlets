# TfsCmdlets Release Notes

## Version 2.4.1 (_20/Jul/2022_)

This release fixes bugs and add improvements to `New-TfsWorkItem` and `Set-TfsWorkItem`.

## Improvements

* Identity fields in `New-TfsWorkItem` and `Set-TfsWorkItem` (such as _"Assigned To"_) now support either email addresses or user display names as valid values. Previously, only user display names were supported.

## Fixes

* Fix _"Set-TfsWorkItem fails with {type} to {type}[] (array) conversion error"_ ([#172](https://github.com/igoravl/TfsCmdlets/issues/172))
* Fix a bug in `New-TfsWorkItem` and `Set-TfsWorkItem` where changes to the **AssignedTo** field would not be reflected in the Work Item.
