# TfsCmdlets Release Notes

## Version 2.3.0 (_19/Mar/2022_)

This release adds initial support for Azure Artifacts and fixes a few bugs related to team membership handling.

## New cmdlets

### Artifacts

* [`Get-TfsArtifact`](https://tfscmdlets.dev/docs/cmdlets/Artifact/Get-TfsArtifact)
* [`Get-TfsArtifactFeed`](https://tfscmdlets.dev/docs/cmdlets/Artifact/Get-TfsArtifactFeed)
* [`Get-TfsArtifactVersion`](https://tfscmdlets.dev/docs/cmdlets/Artifact/Get-TfsArtifactVersion)
* [`Get-TfsArtifactView`](https://tfscmdlets.dev/docs/cmdlets/Artifact/Get-TfsArtifactView)

### Git

* [`Remove-TfsGitBranch`](https://tfscmdlets.dev/docs/cmdlets/Git/Branch/Remove-TfsGitBranch)

## Improvements
  
* Add `-AreaPaths` argument to `New-TfsTeam` so team area paths can be defined at team creation time.

## Fixes

* `Add-TfsTeamAdmin` limited team administrators to users (groups could not be added as admins), even though Azure DevOps supports it. This release litfs this restriction.
* Fix a bug introduced in the last version where `Get-TfsTeamMember` and `Get-TfsTeamAdmin` would not return group members
* Under some circumstances `New-TfsTeam` would not respect `-NoDefaultArea` and `-NoBacklogIteration`
