# TfsCmdlets Release Notes

## Version 2.3.0 (_02/Apr/2022_)

This release adds initial support for Azure Artifacts and fixes a few bugs related to team membership handling.

## New cmdlets

### Artifacts

* [`Get-TfsArtifact`](https://tfscmdlets.dev/docs/cmdlets/Artifact/Get-TfsArtifact)
* [`Get-TfsArtifactFeed`](https://tfscmdlets.dev/docs/cmdlets/Artifact/Get-TfsArtifactFeed)
* [`Get-TfsArtifactVersion`](https://tfscmdlets.dev/docs/cmdlets/Artifact/Get-TfsArtifactVersion)
* [`Get-TfsArtifactFeedView`](https://tfscmdlets.dev/docs/cmdlets/Artifact/Get-TfsArtifactFeedView)

### Git

* [`Remove-TfsGitBranch`](https://tfscmdlets.dev/docs/cmdlets/Git/Branch/Remove-TfsGitBranch)

## Improvements
  
* Add `-AreaPaths` argument to `New-TfsTeam` so team area paths can be defined at team creation time.
* `Get-TfsWorkItem` supports long result sets again. In the previous release, query results were limited to 200 work items due to a limitation in the Azure DevOps "Get Work Items Batch" API. In this version we added back the original behavior as a fallback logic: to fetch work items one at a time to circumvent the limitation. Though slower, it can fetch any number of work items (fixes [#164](https://github.com/igoravl/TfsCmdlets/issues/164)).

## Fixes

* `Add-TfsTeamAdmin` limited team administrators to users (groups could not be added as admins), even though Azure DevOps supports it. This release lifts this restriction.
* Fixes a bug introduced in the last version where `Get-TfsTeamMember` and `Get-TfsTeamAdmin` would not return group members
* Under some circumstances `New-TfsTeam` would not respect `-NoDefaultArea` and `-NoBacklogIteration`
