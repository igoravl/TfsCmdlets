# TfsCmdlets Release Notes

## Version 2.6.0 (_30/Sep/2022_)

This release fixes a bug in `Get-TfsWorkItemQuery` and `Get-TfsWorkItemQueryFolder`, and adds two new cmdlets.

## New cmdlets

* `Undo-TfsWorkItemQueryRemoval` and `Undo-TfsWorkItemQueryFolderRemoval` allow you to undo the deletion of a query or query folder. This is useful when you accidentally delete a query or query folder and want to restore it.

To restore a deleted query:

```powershell
# You can either pipe the deleted query from Get-TfsWorkItemQuery to Undo-TfsWorkItemQueryRemoval...
Get-TfsWorkItemQuery 'My Deleted Query' -Scope Personal -Deleted | Undo-TfsWorkItemQueryRemoval

# ... or you can specify the query directly when calling Undo-TfsWorkItemQueryRemoval
Undo-TfsWorkItemQueryRemoval 'My Deleted Query' -Scope Personal
```

The same applies to query folders - with the distinction that folder can be restored recursively by specifying the `-Recursive` switch. When `-Recursive` is omitted, only the folder itself is restored, without any of its contents. You can then restore its contents by issuing further calls to `Undo-TfsWorkItemQueryRemoval` and/or `Undo-TfsWorkItemQueryFolderRemoval`.

```powershell
# You can either pipe the deleted query from Get-TfsWorkItemQuery to Undo-TfsWorkItemQueryRemoval...
Get-TfsWorkItemQueryFolder 'My Deleted Folder' -Scope Personal -Deleted | Undo-TfsWorkItemQueryRemoval -Recursive

# ... or you can specify the query directly when calling Undo-TfsWorkItemQueryRemoval
Undo-TfsWorkItemQueryFolderRemoval 'My Deleted Folder' -Scope Personal -Recursive
```

## Fixes

* Fixes a bug in `Get-TfsWorkItemQuery` and `Get-TfsWorkItemQueryFolder` where the `-Deleted` switch was not respected and deleted items would not be returned.
