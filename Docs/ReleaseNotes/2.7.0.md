# TfsCmdlets Release Notes

## Version 2.7.0 (_03/Jul/2024_)

This release adds support for suppressing notifications when creating or updating work items.

## New features

* Adds `-SuppressNotifications` switch to `New-TfsWorkItem` and `Set-TfsWorkItem` to suppress notifications when creating or updating work items. This is useful when you are creating or updating a large number of work items and don't want to flood the notification feed of team members.
