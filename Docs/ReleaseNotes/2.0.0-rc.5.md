# TfsCmdlets Release Notes

## Version 2.0.0-rc.5 (_17/Apr/2021_)

Replaces Azure DevOps CI pipeline with one based on GitHub Actions.

## Improvements

- **GitHub Actions workflow**: Although Azure Pipelines has served us well throughout the years, the time has come to replace it with GitHub Actions. Now, the whole build/release pipeline is implemented as a GitHub Actions workflow.

### New cmdlets

- **Set-TfsTeamProject**: This new cmdlet adds support to editing team project details. It is a work in progress, though; presently, it only supports setting the **team project icon ("avatar")**.

## Fixes

- Fix documentation site generation ([cd8bc36](https://github.com/igoravl/TfsCmdlets/pull/127/commits/cd8bc36be5cb31dc8f8285dd365750d5ebf77672))
