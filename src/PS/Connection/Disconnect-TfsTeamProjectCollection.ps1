.SYNOPSIS
    Disconnects from the currently connected team project collection.

.DESCRIPTION
    The Disconnect-TfsTeamProjectCollection cmdlet removes the global variable set by Connect-TfsTeamProjectCollection. Therefore, cmdlets relying on a "default collection" as provided by "Get-TfsTeamProjectCollection -Current" will no longer work after a call to this cmdlet, unless their -Collection argument is provided or a new call to Connect-TfsTeamProjectCollection is made.

.EXAMPLE
	Disconnect-TfsTeamProjectCollection
    Disconnects from the currently connected TFS team project collection

#>
Function Disconnect-TfsTeamProjectCollection
{
	Process
	{
        Disconnect-TfsTeamProject

        if ($Global:TfsTpcConnection)
        {
		    Remove-Variable -Name TfsTpcConnection -Scope Global
		}
	}
}
