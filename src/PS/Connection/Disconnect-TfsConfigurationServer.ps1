.SYNOPSIS
    Disconnects from the currently connected configuration server.

.DESCRIPTION
    The Disconnect-TfsConfigurationServer cmdlet removes the global variable set by Connect-TfsConfigurationServer. Therefore, cmdlets relying on a "default server" as provided by "Get-TfsConfigurationServer -Current" will no longer work after a call to this cmdlet, unless their -Server argument is provided or a new call to Connect-TfsConfigurationServer is made.

.EXAMPLE
    Disconnect-TfsConfigurationServer
    Disconnects from the currently connected TFS configuration server

#>
Function Disconnect-TfsConfigurationServer
{
	Process
	{
        Disconnect-TfsTeamProjectCollection

		if ($Global:TfsServerConnection)
        {
		    Remove-Variable -Name TfsServerConnection -Scope Global
		}
	}
}
