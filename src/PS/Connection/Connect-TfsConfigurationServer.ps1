.SYNOPSIS
    Connects to a configuration server.

.PARAMETER Credential
    ${HelpParam_TfsCredential}

.PARAMETER Passthru
    ${HelpParam_Passthru}

.DESCRIPTION
    The Connect-TfsConfigurationServer function connects to a TFS configuration server. Functions that operate on a server level (as opposed to those operation on a team project collection level) will use by default a connection opened by this function.

.NOTES
    A TFS Configuration Server represents the server that is running Team Foundation Server. On a database level, it is represented by the Tfs_Configuration database. Operations that should be performed on a server level (such as setting server-level permissions) require a connection to a TFS configuration server. Internally, this connection is represented by an instance of the Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Client.TfsConfigurationServer class and is kept in a PowerShell global variable caled TfsServerConnection .

.PARAMETER Interactive
	Prompts for user credentials. Can be used for both TFS and VSTS accounts - the proper login dialog is automatically selected. Should only be used in an interactive PowerShell session (i.e., a PowerShell terminal window), never in an unattended script (such as those executed during an automated build).
